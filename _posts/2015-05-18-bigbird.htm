###7. Brief Description of Each Team Member: (hobbies, strengths, weaknesses, racing background, shooting background, etcâ€¦)
53 year old paper pusher....with occasional stapling of said papers.

I have been in law enforcement for almost 25 years. In my career I have been incredibly fortunate to have had outstanding mentors, and I have been allowed to do things that some people only dream about. Rescue Diver, SRT, Narcotics, Patrol, and now Admin.

 
###8. Why Do You Want to Compete in the Survival Trial?
As my career has proceeded I have moved further into the office and off of the street. During this process I haveallowed other things to take the place of a healthy life style, and soon I found myself being a big blob sitting at a desk.

A few years ago I got sick and tired of being sick and tired. I started moving my body, watching what I stuffed in my face, and eventually lost 70 lbs. 

I then decided that every year I was going to do something to challenge myself. This year my challenge is the Survival Trial STX Sundowner 24 hr.

In preparation for this, I finally had my knee operated on (December 2014). The surgery was a huge success (Just a torn meniscus, so I wasn't a huge surgery). After I was released from the Physical Therapy folks I continued my work out regiment. My workout strategy is simply: I make sure I do something everyday. Weights, running, Cross fit sessions, or just walking.

Tomorrows workout: My wife has decided that it will be to move old rail road ties from the front yard, and then help her finish the laundry. I don't know which is worst...lugging wood all over or folding socks.

 
###9. What Are Your Goals with the Survival Trial?
My goals are simple. Don't get horribly lost, Keep a sense of humor, make sure there is no need for a medical helicopter to locate me, and finish with a smile on my face. 
 
###10.  List any other pertinent information that you feel would be helpful for potential sponsors to know about you:
I think that pretty much covers it......unless one of the sponsors is Dunkin Donuts...in that case, I would really like a chocolate eclair when I finish.
