<h3>7. Brief Description of Each Team Member: (hobbies, strengths, weaknesses, racing background, shooting background, etc…)</h3>

Craig – My hobbies are hunting and Cowboy Action Shooting.  I enjoy being outdoors and especially being in the mountains.  I have grown up in the outdoors and am very comfortable being out in the mountains.  I have shot competitively since 2005 and I believe this could be one the strengths that I bring to the team.  Due to my age that could be a weakness to some but I feel I am in better shape now than I was in my younger years.  I competed in the May Survival Trial in 2013 and feel I am prepared for this 48 hr trial. 

Jon- Hobbies are outdoors, especially hunting and fishing. Enjoy competitive skeet shooting and running.



 
<h3>8. Why Do You Want to Compete in the Survival Trial?</h3>

Craig – I would like to compete in the survival trial as a personal accomplishment in that I can say to myself that I am not too old to compete.  I enjoy the challenge that the survival trial puts us through and with the times we are now living in it is a challenge we all might have to face in our lifetime, so the knowledge and experience gained could help me in the future.

Jon- I have enjoyed the 4 trials I have participated in and have been challenged by all of them differently.  It’s a great excuse to get into great shape and to spend time in beautiful New Mexico.  The Trials have become a metaphor for life- always be prepared and never quit.


 
<h3>9. What Are Your Goals with the Survival Trial?</h3>
Craig – My goals are to be a steady and solid competitor and not let my teammate down, and to leave the trial knowing I did the best I could.

Jon- My goals are to win and not lose my toe nails… again.
