We work closely with technology in Survival Trial with the GPS Tracking and grid location plotting.  We integrated the tracking software back in 2013 and placed the map online so everyone back home could follow the Competitors through the Arenas, but at some point in just about every Survival Trial the map will go down.  I have never fully trusted anything that requires batteries and a connection with something outside of my position.  I have been issued GPS equipment in the military that ended up staying in the rear because it would not work.  My map, compass and protractor were all that I took because I was confident in my ability to use them.  

Knowing how to read a map, plot points and plot a route are skills worth having.  Land Navigation is the fundamental key to success in the Survival Trial Arenas.  This post highlights what you need to know to successfully plot a 10 digit MGRS Coordinate that will identify a location on a map to within 1 meter. 

## What is a map?

A map is a geographic representation of a flat plane as seen from above.  Blue is water; green is vegetation, brown is relief features (such as contour lines), red is populated areas, roads etc…  The contour lines are imaginary lines on the ground that connect equal elevation.  The Contour Lines depict the high and low ground on a map.  The closer they are together, the steeper the walk, the further apart the less grade one will encounter.  This is very important when plotting routes and identifying potential obstacles along the way, especially at night.

We provide 1:50,000 scale maps in the Survival Trial Arenas.  The scale 1:50,000 depicts the area on the map at 1/50,000 of their actual size.  This keeps detail of topography and the grids are broken down into 1000km increments.  This way we can keep the ST Arena to one or two maps, depending on the Trial.

## Plotting Points

You will receive a list of coordinates of specific locations in the Survival Trial Arena.  The coordinates will be in a 10 digit format, bringing you within 1 meter of the specified location.  You should have a military map protractor in your kit; if you do not, then navigating in the Survival Trial Arena will be very difficult.  Once your safety brief is complete and the Trial is underway, you will then plot all of your points, and you should plot every single one.  This will help you in determining the layout and the route(s) you can take in the ST Arena and in formulating a plan of attack in the ST Arena.

### How to plot the point:  13S EA 42961 67552  

Let’s break down the coordinates first.  

* 13S:  Grid Zone Designator:  The large area that the map is showing.  The entire world is broken down into Grid Zone Designators.

* EA:  100km Grid Square Identification:  The area of the Grid Zone Designator the map is part of.

* 42:  North/South running grid line

* 67:  East/West running grid line

To begin, move the protractor along the lower grid line numbers until you reach the lower left hand corner of that line.

In this case, find grid line 42 and place the protractor on the lower left hand corner of the grid square.  

Then align the right hand numbers (bringing you up on the map) until you reach the lower left hand corner of the 1000 meter grid square, in this case grid line 67.

Placing your protractor on the lower left hand corner of grid square 4267, move the protractor to the right until the North/South hash lines line up with 961.  

Identify the East/West hash lines where they read 552.  Place a mark on your map at that location.

You have just plotted point: 13S EA 42961 67552.  You now understand how to breakdown a Grid Zone Designator and why it is used.
