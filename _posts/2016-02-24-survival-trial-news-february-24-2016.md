# Survival Trial - Choose Your Own Adventure!

**Survival Trial is a survival-based adventure race that incorporates Orienteering, Trekking, Survival Skills and Defensive Shooting Situations.  Survival Trial is not a linear race, meaning that the Competitors have the freedom to choose what to do, where to go and in some cases, how to get there.**

**Competitors will also take part in a story-line when negotiating the Daybreaker and Sundowner Arenas.  Choosing Your Own Adventure is a key part of the Survival Trial experience.**

**The reports in this newsletter are fictional and intended to set the stage around the scenarios and situations in the 2016 Survival Trial Arenas.  Every Survival Trial incorporates news articles into the Defensive and Survival Situations to help solidify the relevancy of the Ultimate Test.  Training for Survival Trial should be Training for Everyday.  This means our ST Arenas must reflect the potentials in our everyday lives...**
