<h3>3. Team Name or Solo Callsign:</h3>

NACK 
 
<h3>4. Age of Competitor(s):</h3>

<h3>5. Occupation:</h3>
Newly graduated **and Registered!** Respiratory Therapist, looking for a job in Denver, CO. I'm paying the bills doing odd jobs in the meantime. 
<h3>6. Hometown:</h3>
 Born near Santa Fe, New Mexico. Now living in Denver, Colorado. 
<h3>7. Brief Description of Each Team Member: (hobbies, strengths, weaknesses, racing background, shooting background, etc…)</h3>

I moved to Colorado because I wanted to be closer to the mountains, and to begin a career as an RT. I enjoy backpacking, photography, writing, shooting, and grilling meat.
 
Strengths- Taking very little stuff and doing a lot of things with it.
 
Weaknesses- Far too many for a comprehensive list… 
1 I am relatively untrained with the shotgun, and at present I still don’t own one.
2 My current carbine optic leaves much to be desired. I may just use irons and roll with it, if it comes down to that.
3 This is my first Survival trial, and I don’t know what to expect, aside from significant movement under load.
 
Racing Background- None to speak of.
 
Shooting Background- Trained in pistol, carbine, DRM (Army), and the Oxford comma.

Sponsor information:
Money is tight right now as I look for an RT job. I’m running an old ALICE pack, (loose) yoga/hiking pants, a cotton t shirt and thrifty firearms for the competition. I am training hard and I plan to place well anyway.
I am currently in the market for a cheap and lightweight shotgun, a cheap low-power 5.56 carbine optic with picatinny mount, and some kind of gun belt . I run a very basic (and cheap!) carbine setup. If any companies want to hook me up, I’d be happy to do a write-up and review of equipment before and after the competition. If it's really great, I might buy it outright.
