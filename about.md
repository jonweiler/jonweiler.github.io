<h2 class="post-title">Adventure</h2>
  <p class="post-excerpt">Survival Trial is a one of a kind adventure race, designed to test every Competitor who sets foot in the ST Arena.  Every Survival Trial is different; you will not encounter the same thing in the same way, from Trial to Trial.  We are located in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains at the beautiful NRA Whittington Center, and offer very diverse and rugged environments.</p>
  
 
  <p>Survival Trial is comprised of <strong>Defensive Shooting Scenarios</strong>, <strong>Disaster Response Situations</strong>, <strong>Problem Solving</strong> and <strong>Interaction with Role Players</strong>.</p>

 <h2 class="post-title">Land Navigation/Orienteering</h2> 
  <p class="post-excerpt">Survival Trial is not a linear race; you will have the ability to choose your journey in the ST Arena.  This means that knowing to navigate is crucial to success in Survival Trial.  It also gives you an advantage in the overall strategy of the Competition.  You can choose your route to your advantage. </p> 
  
   
  <p>Nothing is mandatory in the Survival Trial Arena. You can choose to do only the items that fit your strong suits or choose to step outside of you comfort zone and learn a new skill. But getting there is half the battle.</p>
